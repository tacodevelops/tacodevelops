# 💫 About Me:  
Hey, I am Taco, a full-stack developer, game developer, Robotics Engineer, & OS Developer! 
I have been programming for 8 years and creating games for 9 years.
I love making games.
I am now exclusively using Roblox, and I create games for fun.       
I enjoy pushing code to its limits, and I love making tools to automate things!   
I love to collaborate with others and make projects, collaborating with my best friend [@sahleyis](https://github.com/sahleyis), working on Flux with me, and hopefully other projects in the future!
I am a Robotics Engineering Intern @Techmatics.
I love building things for myself or my friends!
Hoping to become the greatest programmer of all time one day, it is a lifelong goal. 

# ❗Warning
-What I post here isn't all of my work, just what I want to show to the public.<br>
-I really like to show stuff, but lots of my projects are just for small groups of my friends, so I like to keep them private, thank you!<br>
-Add Taco_Developz on Discord if you want to talk to me or collab with me, not working anymore unless it has incredible pay!<br>
                                                                                                                                                    
# 📝 What I hope to build in the future!
-My own website, similar to Scratch but with monetization ability!<br>
